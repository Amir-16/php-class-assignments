<!-- You are given an array of strings, ["apple", "dell", "hp", "microsoft", "lenovo",
"fujitsu"].
● You are supposed to reverse all the strings in the array and it would look like
["elppa", "lled", ....]
● You have to reverse the strings in-place. That means, you cannot create a new array
and add reversed strings
● In that new array. You have to reverse a string and replace the original one with the
reversed one in the original list. -->
