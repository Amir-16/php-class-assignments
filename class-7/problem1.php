<!-- . Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and of the same length. Sum those
elements one by one and return a new array of summed items.
 For example, you receive two arrays like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [10, 8, 7, 2, 1].
You have to sum the same index numbers and return [11, 10, 10, 6, 6].
 First items are summed up and added as the first item of the resulting array -->
